## Usage

The extension can be activated by going to the View menu and click on Todo, by using the key command 
CTRL/CMD+ALT+T or by clicking the icon in the toolbar. A panel will be displayed in the bottom of the 
Brackets window displaying all TODO comments within the document in a list.

Clicking on one of the comments in the list will move the cursor to that point in the document.


## Comment Syntax

Todo will by default recognize C-style comments using the [tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_%28computer_programming%29#Tags)
`TODO`, `NOTE`, `FIXME`, `CHANGES` or `FUTURE` as shown in examples below.

Please note that multiline comments will not work. Todo will only return the first line of the comment.

`// TODO: This is a comment.`

`/* NOTE The colon after the tag is optional. */`

`/* @NOTE Preceding at sign is also optional. */`

`# NOTE: This is a comment as well.`

In order to use [JSDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc) style syntax, youâ€™ll have to create a `.todo` file in the root directory of your project with the following code:

```json
{
	"regex": {
		"prefix": "(?:\\/\\*|\\/\\/|#|\\*) *@?("
	}
}
```

## Mark tasks as done

To keep track of your, or your teams, progress you may mark tasks as done. This is achieved by adding `[x]` 
before the text of the task.

`// TODO: [x]This task is done.`


## Custom Settings
The extensions settings can be overridden by adding a `.todo` file in your project folder. This is a simple 
JSON that override default settings with its own.

Custom settings will let you customize what tags are used or the style of comments you wish to use. This will 
allow you to use the extension with other commenting syntaxes including standards like JSDoc and phpDoc or 
bring your own in the form of plain comments in your language of choice. Settings for alternative syntaxes for 
some common standards is listed below.

Please note that backslashes in regular expressions need to be escaped themselves as these are first stored 
within JavaScript strings before parsed as regular expressions.

These are the default settings as they would be set in the `.todo` file.

	{
		"regex": {
			"prefix": "(?:\\/\\*|\\/\\/|#) *@?(",
			"suffix": "):? *(.*?) ?(?=\\*/|\\n|$)"
		},
		"tags": [
			"TODO",
			"NOTE",
			"FIX ?ME",
			"CHANGES",
			"FUTURE"
		],
		"case": false,
		"search": {
			"scope": "current",
			"excludeFolders": [],
			"excludeFiles": []
		}
	}


### Search scope
By default Todo looks at the currently opened document for comments. This is nice for small projects but 
for larger ones you might want to keep an eye on the progress of all parts of the project. This is done 
by changing scope of the search to project instead of current.

```
{
    "search": {
        "scope": "project"
    }
}
```


### Comment Syntax
By adding a prefix and a suffix Todo can recognize comments in other formats and languages. Examples below 
covers some common formats.

#### jsDoc / phpDoc Syntax

	{
		"regex": {
			"prefix": "(?:\* *@)(",
			"suffix": "):? *(.*?) ?(?=\n)"
		}
	}

#### HTML Comment Syntax

	{
		"regex": {
			"prefix": "(?:<!--) *(",
			"suffix": "):? *(.*?) ?(?=-->)"
		}
	}


### Exclude files and folders

Files and folders may be excluded from searches by defining the properties excludeFolders and excludeFiles 
within the search object. These should both be an array of strings containing full, or part of, the file or 
folder names that should be excluded.

Please note that excludes will only work with project wide search scope.

#### Exclude SCSS files

	{
		"search": {
			"scope": "project",
			"excludeFiles": [ ".scss" ]
		}
	}

#### Exclude files with names containing the word index

	{
		"search": {
			"scope": "project",
			"excludeFiles": [ "index" ]
		}
	}

#### Exclude all vendor folders

	{
		"search": {
			"scope": "project",
			"excludeFolders": [ "vendor" ]
		}
	}

#### Exclude ONLY root vendor folder

	{
		"search": {
			"scope": "project",
			"excludeFolders": [ "/vendor" ]
		}
	}
